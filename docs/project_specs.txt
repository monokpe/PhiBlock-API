Summary

Build a Production-Ready AI Prompt Compliance API (FastAPI, NLP, Stripe, HIPAA Redaction)

Project Type: MVP Build

Engagement: Milestone-based, ongoing work possible

🧠 Project Overview

We're developing Guardrails — a real-time API layer that filters AI prompts before they reach LLMs (like OpenAI or Claude). The system detects PII, blocks prompt injection attacks, redacts sensitive content, and applies context-aware rules for frameworks like HIPAA, GDPR, and PCI-DSS.

The product is designed for:

AI tools used by healthcare startups

LLM-based apps built with Bubble, Retool, Zapier, and LangChain

Teams seeking a plug-and-play compliance firewall for GPT-based systems

🧱 What You’ll Build

✅ Phase 1 – Core API

FastAPI app with /v1/analyze endpoint

API key authentication (JWT or hash-based)

Redis rate limiting

Logging to PostgreSQL

PII detection (regex + spaCy)

Prompt injection detection (regex + HuggingFace classifier)

✅ Phase 2 – Compliance Engine

Context-aware compliance logic (HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS)

Risk scoring and violation tagging

Structured text redaction engine

Token usage tracking and deduplication

✅ Phase 3 – Dashboard & Billing (Weeks 5–6)

React dashboard (API usage logs, API key management)

Stripe integration (metered usage billing)

Healthcheck and monitoring hooks (Sentry)

Developer docs (Swagger + markdown)

🧩 Tech Stack

Backend: FastAPI, Python 3.12+

Database: PostgreSQL (via Railway, Supabase, or Render)

Caching: Redis + SlowAPI

NLP: spaCy, HuggingFace Transformers

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Billing: Stripe (usage-based billing)

Monitoring: Sentry, built-in metrics endpoints

Deployment: Railway or Docker-based setup

🧠 About You

You should be confident in:

Building scalable, secure API-first applications

Handling sensitive data with care (e.g., PII, PHI)

Working with NLP tools and ML classifiers

Implementing secure rate limiting, logging, and usage tracking

Delivering end-to-end builds — backend, minimal frontend, deployment

Bonus points if you:

Have experience with LangChain, Bubble, or Zapier plugins

Understand HIPAA/GDPR/PIPEDA-style regulatory logic

Can think like a platform integrator, not just a feature builder
